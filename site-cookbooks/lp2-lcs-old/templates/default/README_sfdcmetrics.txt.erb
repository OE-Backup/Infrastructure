If this node is configured as master: 

* You must uncompress SFDCmetrics tool zip in <%= node['lp2']['sfdcmetrics']['path'] %>/tool/.
  Those zip files are downloaded in the directory <%= node['lp2']['sfdcmetrics']['path'] %>/zips/.

* You must enable SFDCmetrics cron job rule in /etc/cron.hourly (it's already setup but the script it's commented).
